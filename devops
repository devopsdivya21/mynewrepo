A branch represents an independent line of development.
The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches.
The default branch name in Git is master.
allows you to work on different features or changes to your code independently, without
affecting the main or other branches.
It's a way to organise and manage your code changes, making it easier to collaborate and
maintain your project.
